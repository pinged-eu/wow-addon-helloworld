= Installation for Developers

Use powershell and run these commands in an elevated session (run as admin!):

[source,powershell]
----
# this directory here
$myAddonDir = Get-Location
# your WoW directory
$myWoWDir = "G:\World of Warcraft"
# the flavor: usually retail, but can also be _classic_
$flavor = "_retail_"

# create link
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path "$myWoWDir\$flavor\Interface\AddOns\HelloWorld" -Target $myAddonDir
----

Your WoW directory may be different, of course.
